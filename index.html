        <p>IPray Daily ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of our users ("you" or "your").
            This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our

        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and operate the App, including to allow you to create an account and connect with other
                users.</li>
            <li>To personalize your experience with the App by recommending content and features we believe you will be
                interested in.</li>
            <li>To send you promotional communications, such as newsletters and marketing emails (with your consent).
            </li>
            <li>To analyze the use of the App and improve our services.</li>
            <li>To comply with the law and enforce our policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <p>We may share your information with third-party service providers who help us operate the App and provide our
            services. These service providers are contractually obligated to keep your information confidential and
            secure. We will not share your personal information with any third-party for marketing purposes without your
            consent.</p>
